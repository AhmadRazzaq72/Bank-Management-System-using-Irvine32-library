BANKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
=========================

The Banking Management System is a console-based application developed using x86 Assembly Language with the Irvine32 library. It simulates essential banking operations such as user registration, login authentication, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

Built with a focus on low-level programming fundamentals and file handling techniques, the system demonstrates how core banking features can be implemented securely and efficiently in assembly language. It showcases structured programming, file I/O operations, and user interface logic at the hardware-near level.
